          Requiring Support for Appealing to the IESG and IAB
                   draft-eggert-appeal-support-latest

Abstract

   RFC2026 describes the procedure for appealing decisions or process
   failures to the IESG and the IAB.  This document updates RFC2026 and
   requires that an appellant must first gain support for their appeal
   before an appeal may be considered by the body it is submitted to.

1.  Introduction

   Section 6.5 of [RFC2026] outlines how conflicts in the IETF should be
   resolved and describes how matters can be resolved by appealing
   decisions at IESG and IAB level.  The appeal mechanism has proven to
   be an important mechanism for maintaining an open nature of the IETF
   standards process.

   It has been argued that appeals put an asymmetric workload on the
   bodies that handle the appeal.  It has also been argued that the
   appeals process has been abused to stall forward progress
   [MontrealPlenary].

   Therefore, this document updates [RFC2026] in that an appellant MUST
   gain support for entering the appeals process from at least *three*
   active IETF participants ("supporters") for an appeal to be
   considered.  This requirement reduces the likelihood that the appeals
   process will be abused by individuals while still maintaining an open
   and accessible process for conflict resolution.

   Below we describe how this requirement is integrated in the process
   steps and what makes a supporter qualify.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   This document uses the term "supporter".  This is a person with an
   active IETF background (see Section 3).  The supporter only supports
   that the matter at hand should be reviewed by the responsible board
   -- IESG or IAB.  Their support for entering the appeals process
   should in no way be seen as (non-)support for (the view of) the
   appellant, but more for the fact that time of the responsible review
   boards is to be spent on the issue.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Qualified Supporters

   Supporters are intended to have a reasonable IETF experience.  They
   are supposed to be active participants that know the IETF community.

   Therefore, qualified supporters MUST be NomCom-eligible under the
   criteria inSection 3 of [RFC9389], where "the day the call for NomCom
   volunteers is sent" in this context is the day the appeal is raised.

   To keep the dispute resolution as open as possible, there are no
   further requirements on supporters, i.e., Section 4.15 of [RFC8713]
   does *not* apply to potential supporters.  The group of potential
   supporters hence may include members of the IESG, the IAB, etc.

   Qualified supporters MUST NOT have supported the same appellant
   during a previous appeal within the past year.  Qualified supporters
   MAY have supported other appellants.

   Appellants MAY act as a supporter for their own appeal when they meet
   the above criteria.  As a result they can only self-support once.

4.  Mechanics

   Introducing the requirement for three supporters also introduces some
   additional mechanics in the process.  The two normative changes to
   the process described in [RFC2026] are that

   *  three supporters must have filed their support with the appeal-
      handling body at most two weeks after the appeal has been received
      by that body;

   *  the appeal-handling body MAY choose to not consider the appeal if
      there are insufficient qualified supporters.

   Note that the appeal-handling body MAY choose to consider an appeal
   even when there are insufficient qualified supporters.

   It is the responsibility of the appellant to find qualified
   supporters.  In order to find qualified supporters, the appellant MAY
   send a *single* message to *one* public IETF mailing list.

   Supporters SHOULD send their supporting messages personally to the
   appeal-handling body in question and SHOULD NOT proxy their message
   through the appellant.

   If an appellant escalates an appeal from the IESG to the IAB, that
   escalated appeal MUST find new qualified supporters.

5.  Conclusions

   The mechanism proposed herein only applies to appeals to the IESG and
   the IAB.  It does not apply to other forms of dispute resolution.

6.  Security Considerations

   This document specifies neither a protocol nor an operational
   practice, and as such, it creates no new security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
